# Responsive To-Do List


## What this is
A single-file responsive To-Do list app (HTML/CSS/JS). It stores tasks in the browser's localStorage so they persist across page reloads.


## Features
- Add tasks (press Enter or click Add)
- Edit tasks (double-click a task or click the ✏️ button)
- Mark complete with checkbox
- Filter: All / Active / Completed
- Clear completed or clear all
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop


## How to use
1. Save this file as `index.html`.
2. Open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).


## Notes for developers
- Tasks are saved under the localStorage key `todo_tasks_v1`.
- The code is intentionally simple and written for clarity. You can extend it by adding drag-and-drop reorder, due dates, categories, or syncing to a backend.
